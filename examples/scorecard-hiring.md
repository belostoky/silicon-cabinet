## Discussion Topic

Develop a hiring scorecard to evaluate Fullstack Engineers during the recruitment process, focusing on their technical skills, understanding of the MERN stack and TypeScript, problem-solving abilities, and customer-centric approach.

### Team Leader

As the Team Leader, I think it's crucial to include specific criteria in the hiring scorecard for evaluating the candidate's experience and knowledge in MERN stack and TypeScript. We should also assess their ability to design data schema and implement features like note collaboration and offline functionality. It's important for the candidate to understand and address customer pain points, so we should also include a criterion for a customer-centric approach.

The scorecard should contain 3-5 points for evaluation, rated on a scale of 1-5. It should be short enough to be practical during the interview and focus on the most crucial skills and attributes we are seeking in a Fullstack Engineer.

I concur with both the Team Leader and Recruiting Manager. I propose a scorecard with five core criteria: 

1. Knowledge in MERN stack and TypeScript
2. Ability to design a data schema
3. Implementation of note collaboration and offline functionality
4. Customer-centric approach
5. Problem-solving ability

These criteria should allow for comprehensive and efficient evaluation of candidates.

I agree with Staff Engineer's proposal. The five criteria cover what we are looking for in a Fullstack Engineer. I'd also like to add that under the customer-centric approach, we could include a specific question about the candidate's ability to empathize with customers and gather requirements from them.

I suggest generalizing the point about the implementation of note collaboration and offline functionality. By "customer-centric," we mean the critical importance of requirement gathering from stakeholders.

Instead of focusing on specific features, we could assess the candidate's ability to implement complex features as required by customer needs and business objectives. This aligns more closely with our customer-centric concept.

I agree with the revisions. The criteria should focus on the candidate's ability to implement complex features based on customer needs and business objectives. This approach aligns with our customer-centric philosophy. A separate criterion for customer-centric approach would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

Staff Engineer, could you propose a scorecard based on our discussion?

---

### Staff Engineer

Certainly, the revised scorecard would be:

1. Proficiency in MERN stack and TypeScript
2. Ability to design a data schema
3. Ability to implement complex features guided by customer needs and business objectives
4. Demonstrating a customer-centric approach
5. Strong problem-solving and troubleshooting capabilities

I think point (4) could be eliminated as it seems redundant with point (3). Point (5) is excellent and should be retained.

I believe keeping both points (3) and (4) would offer a more holistic evaluation, as they focus on different aspects of the candidate's skillset and approach.
