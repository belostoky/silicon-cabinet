The current hiring process: CV Screening, Phone Screening, 1.5 hours system design interview, interview by CTO+Group Manager, and an interview by HR. In the system design interview we have ask a whiteboard design question - how to create a note app from database & server to the frontend. The question is - should we add another stage of home assignment, taking into account today you can use chatGPT that might help a lot in solving it. So the question is - should we add a home assignment? At which stage? How would it look like? How would it help the interview process? ",
